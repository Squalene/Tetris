# Tetris
This project consists of a fully implemented assembly [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) game meant to be played on a Nios II FPGA architecture.

# Nios II Simulator

The _NiosII.jar_ file contains a simulator that can be used to simulate the game without the need of a FPGA. You only need to launch the .jar, open the tetris.asm file and click on start simulation.  
This allows you to visualise the LED movement as well as the current state of the ROM/RAm and the registers.
